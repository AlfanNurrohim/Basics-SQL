## About

Welcome to my **Basics-SQL** Portfolio repository! Here, you'll find a collection of SQL queries and projects that I've developed as part of my independent study in data analysis. This README serves as a guide to navigating through the contents of this repository.

As a dedicated student passionate about data analysis, I've embarked on a journey to master the fundamentals of SQL (Structured Query Language). SQL is a powerful tool used for managing and manipulating relational databases, making it an essential skill for anyone interested in data analytics and management.

## Contents

In this repository, you'll find a comprehensive overview of SQL fundamentals. I've covered essential topics such as:

1. Basic SQL syntax
2. Retrieving data with SELECT statements
3. Filtering data using WHERE clause
4. Sorting data with ORDER BY
5. Aggregating data using functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG
6. Grouping data with GROUP BY
7. Joining tables using INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN
8. Subqueries for complex data retrieval

## Summary

Day 01:

- Creating databases, tables, and learning basic SQL commands such as **CREATE DATABASE, CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, DROP TABLE,** and **INSERT INTO**.
- Learning about the **ALTER TABLE** command to add, delete, rename, and change column data types.
- Understanding the use of the **INSERT INTO** command to insert data into tables.

Day 02:

- Delving into the **INSERT INTO** command to insert multiple rows of data at once.
- Adding auto-increment to tables using the **ALTER TABLE** command.
- Using the **UPDATE** command to update data in tables.
- Using the **DELETE** command to remove data from tables.

Day 03:

- Learning about the **SELECT** command to retrieve data from tables.
- Understanding the use of the **WHERE** command to set data selection conditions.
- Using logical operators **AND, OR,** and **NOT** to set more than one condition in the **WHERE** command.

Day 04:

- Understanding the **ORDER BY** command to sort query results.
- Using the **LIMIT** command to limit the number of rows produced by a query.
- Learning about the **LIKE** command to match string patterns.
- Understanding the use of the **GROUP BY** and **HAVING** commands to perform data grouping.

Day 05:

- Learning the use of the **BETWEEN** command to find values between two conditions.
- Using the **IN** command to find values matching several specified values.
- Understanding the use of the **DISTINCT** command to retrieve unique values from a column.

Day 06:

- Learning about the use of the **UNION** command to combine results from multiple queries.
- Using the **UNION ALL** command to combine query results without removing duplicates.
- Understanding the **INTERSECT** command to find values that exist in two sets of data.

Day 07:

- Learning the creation of indexes on tables using the **CREATE INDEX** command.
- Using the **ALTER TABLE** command to add and remove indexes.

Day 08:

- Delving into the use of the **JOIN** command to combine data from multiple tables.
- Learning about **INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN,** and **CROSS JOIN**.

Day 09:

- Understanding the **CREATE VIEW** command to create stored data views.
- Using the **DROP VIEW** command to remove existing views.

Day 10:

- Learning about flow control commands such as **CASE** and **IF** in SQL.
- Learning about creating subqueries and their usage in the **SELECT** command.

Day 11:

- Delving into the usage of **CASE** and **IF** in the **SELECT** command.
- Understanding how to write conditions correctly within **CASE**.

Day 13:

- Learning about Common Table Expressions **(CTE)** to write more complex queries.
- Using **CTE** to separate queries into defined parts.

Day 14:

- Learning the creation and invocation of Stored Procedures.
- Understanding the use of parameters in Stored Procedures.
- Delving into query writing techniques using Stored Procedures.

Day 15:

- Understanding the concept of Transactions as a series of operations that must be performed together and guaranteed for success.
- Learning about the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) that determine the characteristics of reliable transactions.
- Using the **BEGIN TRANSACTION, COMMIT,** and **ROLLBACK** commands to manage transactions.

## Sources

In my journey of learning SQL, I have relied on various valuable reference sources. Two primary sources that have been my guides are the [Mysqltutorial](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/) website and [EssentialSQL](https://www.essentialsql.com/). From Mysqltutorial, I gained a deep understanding of various features and concepts within MySQL, while EssentialSQL provides a clear and structured insight into the important fundamentals of SQL. I am deeply grateful to both of these platforms that have helped me expand my knowledge in the world of SQL. Furthermore, I am open to contributions and suggestions.
