## About

Welcome to my Basics SQL Portfolio repository! Here, you'll find a collection of SQL queries and projects that I've developed as part of my independent study in data analysis. This README serves as a guide to navigating through the contents of this repository.

As a dedicated student passionate about data analysis, I've embarked on a journey to master the fundamentals of SQL (Structured Query Language). SQL is a powerful tool used for managing and manipulating relational databases, making it an essential skill for anyone interested in data analytics and management.

## Contents

In this repository, you'll find a comprehensive overview of SQL fundamentals. I've covered essential topics such as:

1. Basic SQL syntax
2. Retrieving data with SELECT statements
3. Filtering data using WHERE clause
4. Sorting data with ORDER BY
5. Aggregating data using functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG
6. Grouping data with GROUP BY
7. Joining tables using INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN
8. Subqueries for complex data retrieval

## Sources

In my journey of learning SQL, I have relied on various valuable reference sources. Two primary sources that have been my guides are the (Mysqltutorial)[https://www.essentialsql.com/] website and (EssentialSQL)[https://www.mysqltutorial.org/]. From Mysqltutorial, I gained a deep understanding of various features and concepts within MySQL, while EssentialSQL provides a clear and structured insight into the important fundamentals of SQL. I am deeply grateful to both of these platforms that have helped me expand my knowledge in the world of SQL. Furthermore, I am open to contributions and suggestions. If you have ideas to enhance this portfolio, feel free to submit a pull request or open a new issue.

Thank you for visiting my Basics SQL Portfolio!
